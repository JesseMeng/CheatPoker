# CheatPoker
My attempt to build along with my previous roommate, a multiplayer android app for the classic game among my high school friends (cheat poker).
PokerHands in CheatPoker(lowest to highest):
singles(high card)
doubles(high card on the double)
double pair(high card on the two pairs)
triple(high card on triple)
straight(high card on the straight)
flush(spade>heart>club>diamond, then high card)
full house(high card on triple, then double)
four of a kind(high card on the four of a kind)
straight flush(spade>heart>club>diamond, then high card)
five of a kind(high card)
six of a kind(high card - the only six card pokerhand in CheatPoker)

CheatPoker is a multiplayer game (2-8) players, in which each player can have anywhere between 3 to 5 cards in the beginning. The goal is to guess a poker hand that might exist among everyone's cards combined and the hand needs to be higher than the previous guess. Each time a player guesses a hand, any other player can try to call him out. Then if the original player's poker hand actually existed, the caller would lose a card for the next round. Otherwise, the player who called the wrong hand would lose a card for the next round. A player is eliminated if he/she has no cards left.
