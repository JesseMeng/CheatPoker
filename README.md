# CheatPoker
My attempt to build along with my previous roommate, a multiplayer android app for the classic gmae among my high school friends (cheat poker).

CheatPoker is a multiplayer game (2-8) players, in which each player can have anywhere between 3 to 5 cards in the beginning. The goal is to guess a poker hand that might exist among everyone's cards combined and the hand needs to be higher than the previous guess.
